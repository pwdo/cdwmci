		<h4 class="h4">Program D.A.S.A.L. &ndash; A JUNPOL Community Transformation Initiative</h4>
		<p>This is in line with Consortium for the Development of Western Mindanao Communities, Inc. or CDWMCI's  thrust of transforming communities into what God wants them to become. This community transformation initiative is through a “Joint Undertaking of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), People’s Organizations (POs) and Local Government Units (LGUs)” – (JUNPOL) starting with a lifestyle of PRAYER (or DASAL in Filipino term) or intimate relationship with God. This is in obedience to God’s Word to build “His House” as a “House of Prayer” for all nations to be saved and disciple (Isaiah 56:7; Matt.21:13; Mark11:17) and fulfill the mandate of the Great Commission (Matt.28:19-20).</p>

		<h4 class="h4">The Ark Project</h4>
		<p>The Christian &amp; Missionary Churches in the Philippines (CMCP) in collaboration with the Consortium for the Development of Western Mindanao Communities, Inc. (CDWMCI) develop and implement the four-pronged initiatives, namely: Micah Initiative, Restoration Initiative, Housing/ Settlement and Livelihood Initiative, and Care for Children Initiative.</p>
		<p>As symbolized by the Ark, these initiatives will serve as a “vessel” to address the social and environmental issues and challenges the people and communities are facing in this post-modern time.  The Project is a faith-based initiative that finds expression in the social development programs of CDWMCI through the following initiatives, to wit:</p>
		<ol class="list">
			<li><strong>The Micah Initiative.</strong> This initiative has Micah 6: 8 as its pivotal inspiration to advocate and promote Christian family values; social justice (peace and security, human rights, and labour); and environmental integrity in a rapidly-deteriorating world.</li>
			<li><strong>The Restoration Initiative.</strong> This is an arm to reach out those in prisons by conducting Bible studies and organizing a community of inmates through Prison Fellowships. It will also develop and implement activities that will not only strengthen every inmate spiritually but will also advocate Fellowship of Former Inmates to help them re-integrate into the society for them to live normal and productive lives.</li>
			<li><strong>Housing/Settlement and Livelihood Initiative.</strong> This caters to the needs of informal settlers and indigenous peoples particularly the Badjao communities. This initiative adopts the following strategies, namely: advocacy with local government agencies and national line agencies for them to enact legislations, develop programs to address housing/ settlement challenges, and  include in their annual budgets the Socialized Housing Program; and linkaging with other social development agencies along housing and shelter issues.</li>
			<li><strong>Care for Children Initiative.</strong> This initiative advocates for stronger government actions in addressing the issue on street-children, children-in-conflict with law, orphans, and out-of-school children and youth.
